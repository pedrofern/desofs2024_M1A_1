## Introduction

The main objective of this document is to present the first sprint P2 implementation decisions.

As we decided in the previous document, we have three main components:
  1. Frontend
  2. Backend
  3. Database

The frontend is developed using Angular, the backend is developed using Java and the database is developed using PostgreSQL.

Additionally, we are using the GitHub Actions to automate the build and deploy process.

All of the work is tracked in the GitHub Issues.
