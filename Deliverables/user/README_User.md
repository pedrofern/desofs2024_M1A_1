# 2. Analysis

## 2.1 Preliminary Software Risk Analysis

The Preliminary Software Risk Analysis is a systematic process crucial for understanding and mitigating potential threats to user data privacy and system integrity. Following the ISO 27005 standard, it combines qualitative and quantitative techniques to identify and assess risks associated with the user aggregate. 

Risks, including unauthorized access to sensitive data and non-compliance with regulations like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) or CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), are categorized and prioritized based on their severity.

Mitigation strategies, such as implementing encryption and multi-factor authentication, are proposed to address these risks. Effective communication and a comprehensive risk management plan ensure stakeholders are informed and proactive measures are taken to safeguard user privacy and data security.

## 2.2 Security Requirements Engineering

Security Requirements Engineering is a crucial process in software development aimed at identifying and documenting security requirements to protect the user aggregate from potential threats and vulnerabilities. 

Following established methodologies like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), Elevation of Privilege), security requirements are systematically elicited from stakeholders and analysed for completeness, consistency, and feasibility.

These requirements encompass aspects such as authentication mechanisms, access control policies, encryption, and audit trails. They are formalized into a specification that serves as a reference throughout the development process. Validation techniques, including reviews, inspections, and testing, ensure that security requirements effectively address potential risks. Compliance requirements related to industry standards and regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, are also integrated.

The requirements identified for the user aggregate are explored and detailed in 2.4 and 2.5 chapters.

## 3.4.8. Threat Analysis

For threat analysis, we will use the STRIDE model to identify potential threats to the user aggregate. STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of Privilege.

| Category  | Property | Violated Description |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| **Spoofing (S)** | **Authentication** | Attackers may attempt to spoof user identities by impersonating legitimate users during the login process. This could involve using stolen credentials, phishing attacks or exploiting weak authentication mechanisms. |
|                |                    | Attackers may attempt to steal user credentials by spoofing login forms or tricking users into entering their credentials on malicious websites. |
|                |                    | Attackers may spoof IP addresses to bypass IP-based access controls and submit forms from unauthorized locations.                                  |
| **Tampering (T)**  | **Data Integrity** | Unauthorized modification of login data during transmission or storage, leading to compromised credentials. This could occur through data interception, man-in-the-middle attacks, or injection vulnerabilities. |
|                |                    | Attackers may tamper with form data, such as modifying hidden fields or intercepting and modifying data in transit, to manipulate system behaviour or submit unauthorized requests. |
|                |                    |  Attackers may tamper with form parameters to bypass validation checks or gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources.                     |
| **Repudiation (R)**| **Non-Repudiation**| Lack of mechanisms to track and verify user login attempts, leading to repudiation of legitimate logins. Without proper logging and auditing, users may deny their login activities, complicating accountability. |
|                |                    | Users may deny submitting certain forms or actions, leading to difficulties in tracing and resolving disputes over the authenticity of submitted data. |
|                |                    | Users may repudiate form submissions, claiming that they did not initiate certain transactions, leading to disputes and challenges in establishing accountability. |
| **Information Disclosure (I)** | **Confidentiality** | Unauthorized access to login credentials or session tokens, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information. This could happen due to weak encryption, insecure storage, or leakage of credentials through various means. |
|                |                    | Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in form processing to disclose sensitive information entered by users, such as personal information, payment details, or confidential documents. |
|                |                    | Insecure error handling may reveal sensitive information in error messages, aiding attackers in crafting targeted attacks or exploiting system vulnerabilities. |
| **Denial of Service (D)** | **Availability** | Malicious actors may launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks to overwhelm the login system, rendering it inaccessible. This could result in legitimate users being unable to log in, leading to service disruptions and user frustration. |
|                |                    |  Attackers may flood form submission endpoints with a large volume of requests, overwhelming system resources and causing denial of service to legitimate users. |
|                |                    |  Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities to exhaust system resources, such as memory or CPU, leading to degradation or unavailability of form submission services. |
| **Elevation of Privilege (E)** | **Authorization** | Exploitation of vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges during the login process, granting unauthorized access. Attackers may bypass authentication controls or manipulate user roles to gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources. |
|                |                    |  Attackers may hijack user sessions to gain unauthorized access to form submission functionalities and perform actions on behalf of legitimate users. |
|                |                    | Exploitation of vulnerabilities may allow attackers to elevate their privileges and gain access to administrative features or sensitive form submission functionalities. |

Additionally, there other ways to analyse the threats, like Attack Trees. Attack trees are graphical representations of potential attack scenarios, illustrating how attackers could exploit vulnerabilities to achieve their objectives. By mapping out attack trees, security teams can identify potential threats, assess their severity and prioritize mitigation efforts.
