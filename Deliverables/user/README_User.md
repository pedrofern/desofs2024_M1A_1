## 2.1 Preliminary Software Risk Analysis

The Preliminary Software Risk Analysis is a systematic process crucial for understanding and mitigating potential threats to user data privacy and system integrity. Following the ISO 27005 standard, it combines qualitative and quantitative techniques to identify and assess risks associated with the user aggregate. 

Risks, including unauthorized access to sensitive data and non-compliance with regulations like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) or CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), are categorized and prioritized based on their severity.

Mitigation strategies, such as implementing encryption and multi-factor authentication, are proposed to address these risks. Effective communication and a comprehensive risk management plan ensure stakeholders are informed and proactive measures are taken to safeguard user privacy and data security.

## 2.2 Security Requirements Engineering

Security Requirements Engineering is a crucial process in software development aimed at identifying and documenting security requirements to protect the user aggregate from potential threats and vulnerabilities. 

Following established methodologies like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), Elevation of Privilege), security requirements are systematically elicited from stakeholders and analysed for completeness, consistency, and feasibility.

These requirements encompass aspects such as authentication mechanisms, access control policies, encryption, and audit trails. They are formalized into a specification that serves as a reference throughout the development process. Validation techniques, including reviews, inspections, and testing, ensure that security requirements effectively address potential risks. Compliance requirements related to industry standards and regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, are also integrated.

Overall, Security Requirements Engineering ensures that security considerations are systematically addressed from the outset, resulting in the development of secure software solutions that safeguard the user aggregate from threats and vulnerabilities.

## 2.3 Abuse Cases

Abuse cases are scenarios that describe how a system could be intentionally misused or exploited for malicious purposes. Here are the abuse cases for the user aggregate:

- **Unauthorized Access**: An attacker gains unauthorized access to the system by exploiting weak authentication mechanisms or stealing user credentials. Once inside, the attacker can view, modify, or delete sensitive user data.

- **Data Theft**: A malicious insider with access to the user aggregate intentionally steals user data for personal gain or to sell it on the black market. The attacker may exfiltrate large amounts of sensitive information, including personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data.

- **Account Takeover**: An attacker compromises a user's account through methods such as phishing or brute-force attacks. With control over the account, the attacker can perform various malicious activities, including unauthorized purchases, identity theft, or spreading of misinformation.

- **Data Manipulation**: A disgruntled employee with access to the user aggregate intentionally modifies user data to cause confusion or harm. For example, the employee may alter user profiles, change account settings, or tamper with transaction records.

- **Service Abuse**: A user exploits vulnerabilities in the system to abuse its resources or functionality. This could include launching denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, spamming other users, or circumventing usage limits to gain unfair advantages.

- **Privacy Violation**: A developer or administrator accesses user data without proper authorization for personal curiosity or to monitor the activities of specific users. This breach of privacy undermines user trust and violates data protection regulations.

- **Data Breach**: A cybercriminal exploits vulnerabilities in the system to gain access to the user aggregate's database. The attacker exfiltrates large volumes of sensitive user data, including usernames, passwords, and payment information, for use in identity theft or other malicious activities.

- **Account Hijacking**: An attacker gains control over multiple user accounts by exploiting a security vulnerability in the system. The attacker may use these hijacked accounts to spread malware, launch phishing attacks, or engage in fraudulent activities.

- **Impersonation**: An attacker impersonates a legitimate user or administrator to gain unauthorized access to the user aggregate. By masquerading as an authorized entity, the attacker can perform actions that would otherwise be restricted, such as viewing sensitive data or modifying system settings.

- **Data Destruction**: A malicious actor launches a destructive attack aimed at disrupting the operations of the user aggregate. This could involve deleting or corrupting user data, system files, or critical infrastructure components, leading to data loss and service downtime.

6. **Error Handling Patterns**:
   - **Custom Error Messages**: Provide informative error messages to users without revealing sensitive information that could aid attackers.
   - **Centralized Error Logging**: Log errors and exceptions centrally to facilitate monitoring, troubleshooting, and incident response.

7. **Logging and Monitoring Patterns**:
   - **Audit Logging**: Log security-relevant events, such as authentication attempts, access control decisions, and data modifications, for auditing and compliance purposes.
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Monitor system behaviour and user activities to detect anomalies indicative of security incidents or unauthorized behaviour.

By leveraging these secure design patterns, developers and architects can build resilient, secure, and reliable systems that effectively mitigate security risks and protect against common threats and attacks.
