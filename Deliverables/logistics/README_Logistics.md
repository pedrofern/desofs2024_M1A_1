# 3. Design
 
## 3.1 Security Risk-Driven Design

Security Risk-Driven Design is an approach that prioritizes security considerations throughout the software design process. Instead of treating security as an afterthought, this methodology integrates security measures from the outset, aligning them closely with identified risks. By analyzing potential security threats and vulnerabilities early in the design phase, teams can make informed decisions to mitigate risks effectively.

### Key Components:
- **Risk Assessment:** Conducting a comprehensive analysis of potential security risks and their potential impact on the software system.
- **Threat Modeling:** Identifying and prioritizing potential threats to the system, considering various attack vectors and their likelihood.
- **Security Controls:** Implementing appropriate security controls and countermeasures to mitigate identified risks.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Establishing mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and assessment of security posture to detect and respond to emerging threats.


## 3.2 Secure Architecture

For the case in mind designing a secure architecture involves considering various layers and components of the system to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data. Here's a high-level overview of a secure architecture for the form submission system:

### Client-Side Security
- Utilize HTTPS for encrypted communication between client and server.
- Implement client-side input validation and CAPTCHA to prevent injection attacks and automated form submissions.

### Authentication and Authorization Layer
- Use secure authentication mechanisms like password hashing and multi-factor authentication.
- Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to form submission functionality based on user roles.

### Form Submission Processing
- Perform input validation and sanitization on all form submissions to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest using strong encryption algorithms.

### Server-Side Security
- Follow secure coding practices and conduct regular code reviews to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities.
- Configure server environments securely and deploy intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) for real-time monitoring.

### Data Storage and Persistence
- Implement secure database configurations with encryption at rest, access controls, and regular backups.
- Use data masking techniques to obfuscate sensitive data in non-production environments.

### Logging and Monitoring
- Log security-relevant events and deploy security information and event management (SIEM) solutions for centralized log management and correlation.

### Third-Party Integrations and Dependencies
- Conduct security assessments of third-party integrations and dependencies to ensure compliance with security best practices.

### Incident Response and Disaster Recovery
- Develop an incident response plan outlining procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.

The security test will focus on evaluating the security measures implemented within the form submission system, including authentication mechanisms, data validation procedures, encryption protocols, access controls, and resilience against common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and brute force attacks.

### Testing Approach:
The testing approach will involve a combination of automated and manual techniques to comprehensively assess the security posture of the form submission system. This will include:

1. **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Utilize automated scanning tools such as Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or Nessus to identify common security vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, broken authentication, and sensitive data exposure.

2. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct manual penetration testing to simulate real-world attack scenarios and identify potential weaknesses in the form submission system. This will involve attempting to bypass authentication controls, manipulate form data, and exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access.

3. **Security Code Review**: Perform a thorough review of the source code underlying the form submission system to identify potential security flaws such as insecure coding practices, improper input validation, or lack of error handling.

4. **User Access Controls Testing**: Evaluate the effectiveness of access controls implemented within the system by attempting to access restricted functionalities or sensitive data without proper authorization.

5. **Session Management Testing**: Assess the resilience of session management mechanisms to prevent session fixation, session hijacking, or session replay attacks.

6. **Data Encryption Assessment**: Verify the adequacy of data encryption protocols used to protect sensitive information entered into forms during transmission and storage.

7. **Social Engineering Testing**: Conduct simulated social engineering attacks to assess the susceptibility of users to phishing attempts, credential theft, or other manipulative techniques.

### Deliverables:
Upon completion of the security testing, the following deliverables will be provided:

- Comprehensive security assessment report detailing
